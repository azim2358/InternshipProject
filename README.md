# Project Overview – MoodMate AI
### MoodMate AI is an intelligent mood tracking and reflection tool developed entirely in Python using a Jupyter Notebook. It supports emotional well-being by inviting users to share their daily thoughts, analyzing the emotional tone using natural language processing (NLP), and responding with thoughtful, supportive messages based on detected sentiment.

#### The system enhances self-awareness by providing personalized motivational quotes aligned with the user's mood, and visual summaries such as word clouds to highlight common themes from journal entries. It also generates weekly mood trend graphs, giving users insight into their emotional fluctuations over time.

Designed with simplicity and emotional intelligence in mind, MoodMate AI blends AI-powered feedback with intuitive visualization — all in a clean, beginner-friendly Python notebook.
